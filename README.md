# MotionSense-ESP
A real-time gesture detection system using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and an ESP-based microcontroller with TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for lightweight machine learning inference. This project enables motion-based control by recognizing predefined gestures with IMU sensor data and processing them on an ESP32
